  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>During the COVID-19 pandemic, I took the initiative to teach myself Python and C++, which sparked a deeper interest in software development. I began completing a variety of online courses to build hands-on experience in Arduino projects, JavaScript, computer programming, and introductory cybersecurity. My professional work with Java at EchoStar further inspired me to enroll in a coding bootcamp, where I focused on strengthening my Java expertise and refining my overall programming skills.</p>
